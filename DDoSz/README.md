# DDoS
This presentation was given to the DC919 chapter on October 8th, 2017. It includes a cheat sheet with a handy list of commands
to generate DDoS attack traffic and a TCP spoofed full three way handshake DDoS tool that I developed.

**WARNING** be super careful using these in your lab environment. RST responsed from your device under test can leak to the Internet
if you're not careful and you could end up DDoS-ing a real IP address.
