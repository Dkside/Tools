# LOIC
TCP/IP Stresser Tool

<strong>History</strong>

I was downloaded the original LOIC within version 1.0.8.0 and changed it to be better without changing the other functions which were worked nice. The grey skin i hope you like it!
Reworked by LifeOwner.

<strong>Features</strong>

○ New stress method called UDPV2 which is no longer crashing too much your computer, it's builded for home connections. (BETA)
○ New skin for more good looking.
○ Checking Online/Offline status of the ip->port.

<strong>New Features Work</strong>

• The UDPV2 work like charm with low builded connections you might get timeout in your internet connection might cause you're too slow. (I tested it with 25MB's Downstream/ 2MB's Upstream).
• The status checker function will be slowly when the ip->port will be offline, so do not worry the program still running and working on it, just the timeout is bigger than usually to make sure it will works for slower connections.

Have fun with it i hope you will like it!
